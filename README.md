## Hi there!

🧑🏽‍💻 I am currently working on the following projects:

- 🔬 R&D on Time-Sensitive Networking:
    1. [KeepON](https://github.com/ChuanyuXue/KeepON-rpi): A driver model to support deterministic traffic on standard NICs
    2. [TSNKit](https://github.com/ChuanyuXue/tsnkit): A scheduling and benchmark toolkit for Time-Sensitive Networking in Python.
    3. [rtgen-kernel](https://github.com/ChuanyuXue/RPiTSN)/[rtgen-dpdk](https://github.com/ChuanyuXue/rtgen-dpdk): A deterministic traffic generator based on kernel/DPDK and NIC offloading function.
- 🪐 [NASA-RETHi-DataSystem](https://github.com/ChuanyuXue/NASA-RETHi-DataService): Developing Resilient Extra-Terrestrial Habitat

🤷 Some small projects from me:
